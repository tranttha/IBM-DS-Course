# Dash Components

### Dataset Used
[Airline Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/airline?cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork-20297740&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ) dataset from Data Asset eXchange


## Let's start creating dash application
### Theme
Analyze flight delays in a dashboard.

Dashboard Components
- Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average national air system delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average security delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average late aircraft delay by reporting airline for the given year.
**NOTE**: Year range should be between 2010 and 2020

### Expected Output
Below is the expected result from the lab. Our dashboard application consists of three components:

- Title of the application
- Component to enter input year
- 5 Charts conveying the different types of flight delay. Chart section is divided into three segments.
- - Carrier and Weather delay in the first segment
- - National air system and Security delay in the second segment
- - Late aircraft delay in the third segment


### To do:
- Design layout for the application.
- Create a callback function. Add callback decorator, define inputs and outputs.
- Review the helper function that performs computation on the provided inputs.
- Create 5 line graphs.
- Run the application.

## Get the tool ready
Install python packages required to run the application. Copy and paste the below command to the terminal.

    python3.8 -m pip install packaging
    python3.8 -m pip install pandas dash

## TASK 1 - Read the data
Letâ€™s start with

- Importing necessary libraries
- Reading the data

Copy the below code to the flight_delay.py script and review the code.

    # Import required libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import plotly.graph_objects as go
    import dash
    from dash import dcc
    from dash import html
    from dash.dependencies import Input, Output
    import plotly.express as px
    # Read the airline data into pandas dataframe
    airline_data =  pd.read_csv('https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/airline_data.csv', 
                                encoding = "ISO-8859-1",
                                dtype={'Div1Airport': str, 'Div1TailNum': str, 
                                    'Div2Airport': str, 'Div2TailNum': str})

## TASK 2 - Create dash application and get the layout skeleton
Next, we create a skeleton for our dash application. Our dashboard application layout has three components as seen before:

- Title of the application
- Component to enter input year inside a layout division
- 5 Charts conveying the different types of flight delay
Mapping to the respective Dash HTML tags:

- Title added using html.H1() tag
- Layout division added using html.Div() and input component added using dcc.Input() tag inside the layout division.
- 5 charts split into three segments. Each segment has a layout division added using html.Div() and chart added using dcc.Graph() tag inside the layout division.
Copy the below code to the flight_delay.py script and review the structure.

**NOTE**: Copy below the current code

    # Create a dash application
    app = dash.Dash(__name__)
    # Build dash app layout
    app.layout = html.Div(children=[ html.H1(),
                                    html.Div(["Input Year: ", dcc.Input()],
                                    style={'font-size': 30}),
                                    html.Br(),
                                    html.Br(), 
                                    html.Div([
                                            html.Div(),
                                            html.Div()
                                    ], style={'display': 'flex'}),
        
                                    html.Div([
                                            html.Div(),
                                            html.Div()
                                    ], style={'display': 'flex'}),
                                    
                                    html.Div(, style={'width':'65%'})
                                    ])
**NOTE**: We are using display as flex for two outer divisions to get graphs side by side in a row.

## TASK 3 - Update layout components
### Application title
- Title as Flight Delay Time Statistics, align text as center, color as #503D36, and font size as 30.
### Input component
- Update dcc.Input component id as input-year, default value as 2010, and type as number. Use style parameter and assign height of the input box to be 35px and font-size to be 30.
### Output component - Segment 1
Segment 1 is the first html.Div(). We have two inner division where first two graphs will be placed.

#### Skeleton

    html.Div([
            html.Div(),
            html.Div()
            ], style={'display': 'flex'}),

#### First inner division
- Add dcc.Graph() component.
- Update dcc.Graph component id as carrier-plot.
#### Second inner division
- Add dcc.Graph() component.
- Update dcc.Graph component id as weather-plot.
### Output component - Segment 2
Segment 2 is the second html.Div(). We have two inner division where the next two graphs will be placed.

#### Skeleton

    html.Div([
            html.Div(),
            html.Div()
            ], style={'display': 'flex'}),

#### First inner division
- Add dcc.Graph() component.
- Update dcc.Graph component id as nas-plot.
#### Second inner division
- Add dcc.Graph() component.
- Update dcc.Graph component id as security-plot.
### Output component - Segment 3
Segment 3 is the last html.Div().

#### Skeleton

    html.Div(, style={'width':'65%'})

- Add dcc.Graph() component to the first inner division.
- Update dcc.Graph component id as late-plot.
## TASK 4 - Review and add supporting function
Below is the function that gets input year and data, perform computation for creating charts and plots.

Copy the below code to the flight_delay.py script and review the structure.

**NOTE**: Copy below the current code

    """ Compute_info function description
    This function takes in airline data and selected year as an input and performs computation for creating charts and plots.
    Arguments:
        airline_data: Input airline data.
        entered_year: Input year for which computation needs to be performed.
        
    Returns:
        Computed average dataframes for carrier delay, weather delay, NAS delay, security delay, and late aircraft delay.
    """
    def compute_info(airline_data, entered_year):
        # Select data
        df =  airline_data[airline_data['Year']==int(entered_year)]
        # Compute delay averages
        avg_car = df.groupby(['Month','Reporting_Airline'])['CarrierDelay'].mean().reset_index()
        avg_weather = df.groupby(['Month','Reporting_Airline'])['WeatherDelay'].mean().reset_index()
        avg_NAS = df.groupby(['Month','Reporting_Airline'])['NASDelay'].mean().reset_index()
        avg_sec = df.groupby(['Month','Reporting_Airline'])['SecurityDelay'].mean().reset_index()
        avg_late = df.groupby(['Month','Reporting_Airline'])['LateAircraftDelay'].mean().reset_index()
        return avg_car, avg_weather, avg_NAS, avg_sec, avg_late

## TASK 5 - Add the application callback function
The core idea of this application is to get year as user input and update the dashboard in real-time. We will be using callback function for the same.

Steps:

- Define the callback decorator
- Define the callback function that uses the input provided to perform the computation
- Create graph and return it as an output
- Run the application
Copy the below code to the flight_delay.py script and review the structure.

**NOTE**: Copy below the current code

    # Callback decorator
    @app.callback( [
                Output(component_id='carrier-plot', component_property='figure'),
                ---
                --- 
                ---
                ---
                ],
                Input(....))
    # Computation to callback function and return graph
    def get_graph(entered_year):
        
        # Compute required information for creating graph from the data
        avg_car, avg_weather, avg_NAS, avg_sec, avg_late = compute_info(airline_data, entered_year)
                
        # Line plot for carrier delay
        carrier_fig = px.line(avg_car, x='Month', y='CarrierDelay', color='Reporting_Airline', title='Average carrier delay time (minutes) by airline')
        # Line plot for weather delay
        weather_fig = ------
        # Line plot for nas delay
        nas_fig = ------
        # Line plot for security delay
        sec_fig = ------
        # Line plot for late aircraft delay
        late_fig = ------
                
        return[carrier_fig, weather_fig, nas_fig, sec_fig, late_fig]
    # Run the app
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run_server()

## TASK 6 - Update the callback function
### Callback decorator
- Refer examples provided here
- We have 5 output components added in a list. Update output component id parameter with the ids provided in the dcc.Graph() component and set the component property as figure. One sample has been added to the skeleton.
- Update input component id parameter with the id provided in the dcc.Input() component and component property as value.
### Callback function
Next is to update the get_graph function. We have already added a function compute_info that will perform computation on the data using the input.

Mapping the returned value from the function compute_info to graph:

- avg_car - input for carrier delay
- avg_weather - input for weather delay
- avg_NAS - input for NAS delay
- avg_sec - input for security delay
- avg_late - input for late aircraft delay
Code has been provided for plotting carrier delay. Follow the same process and use the above mapping to get plots for other 4 delays.
